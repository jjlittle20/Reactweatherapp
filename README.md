# What I Learnt #

I made this app that calls the current weather of the city that the user inputs and displays useful information on the screen. This is calling the https://openweathermap.org/api
API. I Learnt how to useState and the extract the relevant information from the calls and display it on screen an example would be that in the className "temp" im am using the state of 'weather' after setting it from the setWeather once the input search has been started. so {weather.main.temp} goes through the weather state and finds the result of 'main' and the inside main it finds the 'temp' and displays the result.

# Styleing #

I used CSS Grid for most of the styleing layout  and used Grid template area as it was very easy to make responsive. I also used glassmorphism for the cards as i feel this gave it a nice look overall.
